# Core Spring and Spring Boot Lab Projects

Labs for the Core Spring and Spring Boot courses: https://github.com/platform-acceleration-lab/core-spring-course.

For now the optional labs (numbered 70 and above) are excluded from the parent POM in `lab/` directory.

To import these labs into your IDE, import the parent pom `lab/pom.xml`.
