# TODO-07 : Configure Hibernate
#   -   Define properties to make Spring Boot to run the same database
#       populating scripts that SystemTestConfig currently runs.
#   -   Define Spring Boot properties to make JPA show the SQL it is running
#       nicely formatted
#   -   Define a Spring Boot property to PREVENT hibernate running DDL
#       automatically - the scripts already setup the database, we don't
#       need hibernate to do it. (The property you need was in the slides).
#   -   Run RewardNetworkTests. Verify it succeeds.
